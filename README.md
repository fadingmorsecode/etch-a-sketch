# Project Summary
Etch A Sketch is where your creativity can blossom. You'll have plenty of space to create drawings to your heart's desire. 
- Create temporary drawings with the hover of your cursors
- A new sketch button with grid sizes up to 100x100
- A rainbow button that randomly selects colors for the pixels on the canvas 
- An eraser button to remove the colored pixels on the canvas
- A clear button to reset to a blank canvas

# A few comments 
While I could have made the Etch A Sketch project more like a drawing pad, I figured trying to replicate an Etch A Sketch adds another layer of creativity for the user. Just as the last project I did, etch-a-sketch has been a way for me to utilize DOM manipulation and event listeners with functions.
